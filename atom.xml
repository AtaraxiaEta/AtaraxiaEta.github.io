    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rencently I found that I have many articles not classified in EverNote,more than 100 articles.<br>I wanna establish my own knowledge system,because Google always knows more than you. Information become knowledge only when you integrate it! Integrate information  including the curriculum itself, between the curriculums, as well as interdisciplinary knowledge integration, these are the most important, and reflect personal values.But I’m  far from that. I have study computer science for two years now, and I think I already have some ideas about the subject. It’s thime for me to try to intergrate the knowledge I have learned.</p>
<p>I just finished the animation Bojeck horseman,use a word to discribe it: Absurd and unreasonable everywhere ,but always touching your heart.<br><strong>I will write a review if I have time.</strong></p>
<p>Finally I finished my compiler principle experiment, but I still have other experiments on Wednesday and Thursday. ╮(╯▽╰)╭</p>
<p>I have not finished The little Prince at present, so, Sun Fei, I have to update it later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I read a book about “face”  –《看脸》. I’d like to make a summary of the book later.<br>And I read a article about consciousness&amp;vision  this morning – <em>What are we talking about when we say “consciousness”</em><br>Click–&gt;<a href="http://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/visualthinking/20287372" target="_blank" rel="external">我们说『意识』的时候，我们在说些什么?</a><br>This article mainly said that it’s difficult for us to measure consciousness and why difficult?<br>I made a parallelism sentence after reading this article:<br>你以为你说出来的这句话，其实也许并不是他们听到的那句话。（基于对词汇认知的偏差）<br>你以为你披在外面的这张脸，其实也不是别人看到的那张脸。（基于人脸的不对称和个人看镜子与他人看你脸的方向是左右相反的）<br>你以为你看到的这世间万物，其实也并不是别人看到的那世界。（基于人的认知只是客观世界的一小部分）</p>
<p>I saw the movie 《业火的向日葵》today after class, which is another theatrical version about detective Conan.<br>Conan used to be my favorite animation when I was a junior school student,but I don’t fanatical in it anymore. Maybe it just because I can’t get anything touched me except some basic detective knowledge from this animation. It can’t make me think deep and inspired me. But when I saw the moive today,I can still remember every character in all details, waht he like or what she don’t like.<br><em>What you once cherish never dies in the river of time, though these things no longer exist in your life, probably.</em></p>
<p>I still have too many things todo recently, but sometime I just not sure where to start. (I think maybe that’s why I can’t do things well). Another problem is I can’t focus on one thing for a long time(30min or more), and I’am easily to think about the things that not relevant to the subject when I studying. But according to my perspection, some guys can!! We’re totally different kinds of people.o(╯□╰)o</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Share a blog about neuro&amp;brain.<br>Click–&gt;<a href="http://neuroscientist.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Neuroscience for beginners V2.0</a><br>This blog serves as the notes repository for MOOC Neuroscience ventures which include notes about<br>the course SYNAPSES, NEURONS AND BRAIN. I just finished the course this month, and these notes helped me a lot. </p>
<hr>
<p>I have lots of programming experiment to do in the following few weeks. I think I will spend much more time in study than before because of my poor programming skills. Most of time I just don’t know where to start. So I decide to read some books about how to design programs and review the basic knowledge about C/C++ language.</p>
<p>Here are some books&amp;articles I find today:</p>
<p>How to design programs –MIT Press<br><em>The book introduces the concept of a design recipe, a six-step process for creating programs from the problem statement. While the book was originally used in conjunction with the TeachScheme! project (now ProgramByDesign), it has been adopted at a number of colleges and universities for the teaching of program design principles. –via Wikipedia </em><br>But I won’t read this book recently, because this is discussing about how to design programs using LISP language which different from C/C++/JAVA that I learned.</p>
<p>And another book(or notes?) is 《设计模式精解–GoF 23种设计模式解析 附C++实现源码》<br>This book is more useful to me now.</p>
<p>And I think I should pay more attention to oprate system&amp;database princple. I just haven’t have chance to open these textbooks after class!</p>

<span class="string">"hebb0"</span>: <span class="string">"[SOUNDS]"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb1"</span>: <span class="string">"Anyway... how do we learn these fears in the first place?"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb2"</span>: <span class="string">"Well, to explain that, let me get rid of all this..."</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb3"</span>: <span class="string">"and give you..."</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb4"</span>: <span class="string">"this!"</span>,

<span class="string">"hebb5"</span>: <span class="string">"Hebbian Learning."</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb6"</span>: <span class="string">"“Neurons that fire together, wire together.”"</span>,

<span class="string">"hebb7"</span>: <span class="string">"This is a rule of thumb that neuroscientists use to describe how"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb8"</span>: <span class="string">"neurons make new connections."</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb9"</span>: <span class="string">"Basically, if you fire one neuron, then fire another neuron,"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb10"</span>: <span class="string">"the first neuron will connect TO the second neuron."</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb11"</span>: <span class="string">"Try it out for yourself!"</span>,

<span class="string">"hebb12"</span>: <span class="string">"Too slow! You didn't click fast enough. Try again?"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb13"</span>: <span class="string">"Not close enough. Try a different pair of neurons."</span>,

<span class="string">"hebb14"</span>: <span class="string">"And that's how we learn!"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb15"</span>: <span class="string">"Of course, we don't learn that quickly in real life,"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb16"</span>: <span class="string">"I sped this simulation up, eh, but still."</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb17"</span>: <span class="string">"Now play around, make a few more connections,"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb18"</span>: <span class="string">"maybe make a chain or something."</span>,

<span class="string">"hebb19"</span>: <span class="string">"This learning rule is why, if you were bitten by a dog as a kid,"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb20"</span>: <span class="string">"you might develop a fear of dogs!"</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb21"</span>: <span class="string">"Because your 'dog' neuron fired, then your 'pain' neuron fired."</span>,
<span class="string">"hebb22"</span>: <span class="string">"And thus, 'dog' connected to 'pain'."</span>,

<span class="string">"anti3"</span>: <span class="string">"Another rule of thumb neuroscientists have!"</span>,

<span class="string">"anti4"</span>: <span class="string">"So - if you already have a connection from one neuron to another,"</span>,
<span class="string">"anti5"</span>: <span class="string">"and you fire the first neuron WITHOUT firing the second neuron,"</span>,
<span class="string">"anti6"</span>: <span class="string">"the connection weakens."</span>,
<span class="string">"anti7"</span>: <span class="string">"Again, try it out."</span>,

<span class="string">"anti8"</span>: <span class="string">"That neuron didn't have any connections."</span>,
<span class="string">"anti9"</span>: <span class="string">"You need to find one that's connected."</span>,
<span class="string">"anti10"</span>: <span class="string">"Ah, so that neuron only has connections going TO it, but not FROM it."</span>,
<span class="string">"anti11"</span>: <span class="string">"You need to find one that has connections FROM it."</span>,

<span class="string">"anti12"</span>: <span class="string">"Now wait for it..."</span>,
<span class="string">"anti13"</span>: <span class="string">"And look! The connection's weaker."</span>,
<span class="string">"anti14"</span>: <span class="string">"Do that again, and this time, the connection will be totally killed."</span>,

<span class="string">"anti15"</span>: <span class="string">"And this unlearning rule is why, if you have a fear of dogs,"</span>,
<span class="string">"anti16"</span>: <span class="string">"and you're exposed to friendly dogs over and over again,"</span>,
<span class="string">"anti17"</span>: <span class="string">"you might unlearn that fear."</span>,
<span class="string">"anti18"</span>: <span class="string">"'Dog' neuron gets fired, WITHOUT the 'pain' neuron getting fired,"</span>,
<span class="string">"anti19"</span>: <span class="string">"and therefore - the connection weakens."</span>,
